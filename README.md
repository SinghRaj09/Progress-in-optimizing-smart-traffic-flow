# Progress in Optimizing Traffic Flow üö¶

## Overview
This project focuses on developing models and strategies to optimize urban traffic flow, aiming to reduce congestion, travel time, and environmental impacts.

## We have:
- Built predictive models using **Random Forest** for key factor identification.
- Implemented **Optimization Algorithms** like **Genetic Algorithms** and **Linear Programming**.
- Used **LSTM Networks** for forecasting traffic patterns.

## Language Used:
- Python üêç

## Objectives:
- Perform **EDA** on traffic datasets.
- Build **Optimization Models** for traffic signal timings.
- Forecast future traffic using **LSTM**.
- Evaluate and visualize results.

## Dataset Sources:
- OpenStreetMap (OSM)
- INRIX Traffic Data
- City Transportation Datasets
