Progress in Optimizing Traffic Flow ðŸš¦ðŸš—
Overview
This project focuses on developing models and strategies to optimize urban traffic flow, aiming to reduce congestion, travel time, and environmental impacts. By analyzing traffic data, infrastructure parameters, and external factors, predictive models and optimization techniques are implemented to improve traffic movement and urban mobility efficiency.

We have:

Built predictive models using Random Forest for identifying key traffic-influencing factors.

Implemented Optimization Algorithms (e.g., Genetic Algorithms, Linear Programming) to propose efficient traffic signal timings and route recommendations.

Used Time-Series Forecasting Models (e.g., LSTM) for predicting future traffic patterns.

Language Used:
Python

Objectives
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on traffic and infrastructure datasets.

Preprocess data and engineer relevant features.

Use Random Forest to select critical factors affecting traffic flow.

Build Optimization Models to suggest improvements in signal timings and routing.

Forecast future traffic patterns using LSTM networks.

Evaluate model performance and robustness.

Visualize key findings and provide actionable recommendations for traffic management authorities.
